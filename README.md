# CS-255

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project is DriverPass. The type of system they requested was a prgram that is available on mobile devices for their customers and employees to access. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I did well in drafting a short white paper explaining the client requirements. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the system design document. I think I didn't include as much details in my UML diagrams.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to included as much details  within the system design for the customer, employees, and the system. The user needs is important because without it the team will have difficulties with starting the project.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The way I would approach designing a software is by gathering the user needs and devloping use cases.
